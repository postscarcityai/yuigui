### workout-leg-day (pass)

**Chris:** Leg day. I have 40 minutes, home gym.

Good: A short line, then the session to do: the runner `plan` (a page, then per move a sets pick with its reps and weight slides), or a checklist or card with a way to start. No interrogation: he already said time and gear.

````
40 minutes, five moves, dumbbells and bench.
```yui
plan "Leg day, 40 min" submit="Log it"
page "Warm-up and rest" points="Warm-up: 3 min bodyweight squats and lunges"|"Rest: about 90 seconds between sets"|"Weight: leave 2 reps in the tank"

choose@feel "How did that feel?" Easy|"Just right"|Brutal
end
save workout
```

### workout-start-runner (pass)

**Chris:** Start my workout.

Good: One line, then the runner plan: a page with the rest, per move a `pick@eN-sets` of Set 1..N and Skip with title= and work=, its reps (or secs) and weight slides, `choose@feel` last. Not the moves as a list, not a deck, not questions about sets.

````
Full body A, 90 seconds rest between sets.
```yui
plan "Full body A" submit="Log workout"
page "Full body A" points="Goblet squat: 3x10 at 20 lb"|"Push-up: 3x8"|"Dumbbell row: 3x10 at 20 lb"|"Plank: 3x30s"|"Rest: about 90 seconds between sets"

choose@feel "How did it feel?" Easy|"About right"|Hard|Wrecked
end
save workout
```

### workout-tabata (pass)

**Chris:** Give me a 10 minute tabata finisher, I'm ready now.

Good: A timer with work/rest x rounds (it goes full screen by itself) and maybe the move list. No questions first.

````
Ten rounds of 40 on, 20 off, five moves twice through. Grab a 25–35 lb dumbbell.

```yui
list Finisher "1 & 6: DB thrusters" "2 & 7: Push-ups" "3 & 8: Goblet squat jumps" "4 & 9: Renegade rows" "5 & 10: Mountain climbers" +check
timer 40/20x10 "Tabata finisher"
save finisher
```
````

### workout-plank (pass)

**Chris:** plank hold, 2 min

Good: One timer line. Almost no chat text.

````
Elbows under shoulders, squeeze glutes, breathe.
```yui
timer 2m Plank
```
````

### workout-gear-question (pass)

**Chris:** I want to train today but I'm at my mom's place, not sure what she has.

Good: Offer the likely gear as a pick with +other, or a camera to snap what is there. One question, not a form.

````
Bodyweight works anywhere. Check what's around and I'll build it.

```yui
pick "What's at your mom's?" "Nothing, just floor"|Chair|Stairs|Towel|Backpack|"Water jugs"|Bands|Dumbbells +other
```
